Eligibility Requirements for Use of Form 1-A.\\nTh is Form is to be used for securities off  erings made pursuant to Regulation A (17 CFR 230.251 et seq.).\\nCareful attention should be directed to the terms, conditions and requirements of Regulation A, especially Rule \\n251, because the exemption is not available to all issuers or for every type of securities transaction. Further, the aggregate off  ering price and aggregate sales of securities in any 12-month period is strictly limited to $20 million \\nfor Tier 1 off  erings and $75 million for Tier 2 off  erings, including no more than $6 million off  ered by all selling \\nsecurityholders that are affi   liates of the issuer for Tier 1 off  erings and $22.5 million by all selling securityholders \\nthat are affi   liates of the issuer for Tier 2 off  erings. Please refer to Rule 251 of Regulation A for more details.\\nII. Preparation, Submission and Filing of the Off  ering Statement.\\nAn off  ering statement must be prepared by all persons seeking exemption under the provisions of Reg-\\nulation A. Parts I, II and III must be addressed by all issuers. Part II, which relates to the content of the required off ering circular, provides alternative formats, of which the issuer must choose one. General informa- tion \\nregarding the preparation, format, content, and submission or fi  ling of the off  ering statement is contained in \\nRule 252. Information regarding non-public submission of the off  ering statement is contained in Rule 252(d). \\nRequirements relating to the off  ering circular are contained in Rules 253 and 254. Th  e off  ering statement must \\nbe submitted or fi  led with the Securities and Exchange Commission in electronic format by means of the Com- \\nmission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System (EDGAR) in accordance with the EDGAR rules set forth in Regulation S-T (17 CFR Part 232) for such submission or fi  ling.\\nIII.

All that is required as to the nature of the underwriters' obligation is whether the underwriters are or\\nwill be committed to take and to pay for all of the securities if any are taken, or whether it is merely an agency or the \\ntype of best eff  orts arrangement under which the underwriters are required to take and to pay for only such securi-\\nties as they may sell to the public. Conditions precedent to the underwriters' taking the securities, including market outs, need not be described except in the case of an agency or best eff  orts arrangement.\\n2.

At the bot-\\ntom of the table, provide the total number of securities being off  ered for the account of all securityholders and\\ndescribe what percent of the pre-off  ering outstanding securities of such class the off  ering represents.\\nInstruction to Item 5(d):\\n Th  e term “securityholder” in this paragraph refers to benefi  cial holders, not nominee holders or other such \\nholders of record. If the selling securityholder is an entity, disclosure of the persons who have sole or shared voting or \\ninvestment power must be included.\\n(e) Describe any arrangements for the return of funds to subscribers if all of the securities to be off  ered are\\nnotsold. If there are no such arrangements, so state.(f) If there will be a material delay in the payment of the proceeds of the off  ering by the underwriter to thePage 14is- suer, the salient provisions in this regard and the eff  ects on the issuer must be stated.\\n(g) Describe any arrangement to (1) limit or restrict the sale of other securities of the same class as those\\nto be off  ered for the period of distribution, (2) stabilize the market for any of the securities to be off  ered, or (3)\\nwith- hold commissions, or otherwise to hold each underwriter or dealer responsible for the distribution of itspartici- pation.\\n(h) Identify any underwriter that intends to confi  rm sales to any accounts over which it exercises discretion-\\nary authority and include an estimate of the amount of securities so intended to be confi  rmed.\\nInstruction to Item 5:\\nAttention is directed to the provisions of Rules 10b-9 [17 CFR 240.10b-9] and 15c2-4 [17 CFR 240.15c2-4] under \\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Use of Proceeds to IssuerState the principal purposes for which the net proceeds to the issuer from the securities to be off  ered are in- \\ntended to be used and the approximate amount intended to be used for each such purpose. If the issuer will not \\nreceive any of proceeds from the off  ering, so state.\\nInstructions to Item 6:\\n1. If any substantial portion of the proceeds has not been allocated for particular purposes, a statement\\nto that eff  ect must be made together with a statement of the amount of proceeds not so allocated.\\n2. State whether or not the proceeds will be used to compensate or otherwise make payments to offi   cers\\nor directors of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries.\\n3. For best eff  orts off  erings, describe any anticipated material changes in the use of proceeds if all of the\\nsecurities being qualifi  ed on the off  ering statement are not sold.\\n4. If an issuer must provide the disclosure described in Item 9(c) the use of proceeds and plan of opera- \\ntions should be consistent.\\n5. If any material amounts of other funds are to be used in conjunction with the proceeds, state the\\namounts and sources of such other funds and whether such funds are fi  rm or contingent.\\n6. If any material part of the proceeds is to be used to discharge indebtedness, describe the material\\nterms of such indebtedness. If the indebtedness to be discharged was incurred within one year, describe the use of the proceeds arising from such indebtedness.\\n7. If any material amount of the proceeds is to be used to acquire assets, otherwise than in the ordinary\\ncourse of business, briefl  y describe and state the cost of the assets. If the assets are to be acquired from affi   li- ates of \\nthe issuer or their associates, give the names of the persons from whom they are to be acquired and set forth the basis used in determining the purchase price to the issuer.\\n8. Th  e issuer may reserve the right to change the use of proceeds, so long as the reservation is promi- nently\\ndisclosed in the section where the use of proceeds is discussed.

Provide information regarding signifi  cant factors, including unusual or infrequent\\nevents or transactions or new developments, materially aff  ecting the issuer’s income from operations, and, in\\neach case, indicating the extent to which income was so aff  ected.

If the causes for a change in one line item also relate to other line items, no repetition is required\\nand a line-by-line analysis of the fi  nancial statements as a whole is not required or generally appropriate. Issuers\\nneed not recite the amounts of changes from year to year which are readily computable from the fi  nancial state-\\nments. Th  e discussion must not merely repeat numerical data contained in the consoli- dated fi  nancial statements.\\n3. When interim period fi  nancial statements are included, discuss any material changes in fi  nancial condition\\nfrom the end of the preceding fi  scal year to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided.

Issuers (including predecessors) that have not received revenue from operations \\nduring each of the three fi  scal years immediately before the fi  ling of the off  ering statement (or since inception, \\nwhich- ever is shorter) must describe, if formulated, their plan of operation for the 12 months following the commence- ment of the proposed off  ering. If such information is not available, the reasons for its unavailability \\nmust be stated. Disclosure relating to any plan must include, among other things, a statement indicating whether, \\nin the issuer’s opinion, the proceeds from the off  ering will satisfy its cash requirements or whether it anticipates \\nit will be necessary to raise additional funds in the next six months to implement the plan of operations.\\n(d) Trend information. Th  e issuer must identify the most signifi  cant recent trends in production, sales and \\ninventory, the state of the order book and costs and selling prices since the latest fi  nancial year. Th  e issuer also \\nmust discuss, for at least the current fi  nancial year, any known trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or \\nevents that are reasonably likely to have a material eff  ect on the issuer’s net sales or revenues, income from con- \\ntinuing operations, profi  tability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause reported fi  nancial information \\nnot necessarily to be indicative of future operating results or fi  nancial condition.\\nItem 10.
